# Hospital Management Database

Created a Hospital Management Database to show my processes for how to create, alter and drop tables, 
use Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) and finally, insert, update and delete rows in the database.
I wrote scripts using T-SQL in Azure Data Studio and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
Most actions can be replicated by using the object explorer.
I also practiced backing up and restoring the DB and managing security permissions of the database.
